# Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

As you are learning the fork command, it will be helpful to test on virtual box as opposed to the Khoury servers. :)</li></ul></li><li>20% Can successfully execute processse in the foreground.<li> 10% for a working pipe.<ul><li>Note: I notice a lot of students spend a great deal of time on pipe early on and get stuck. Leave this towards the end, it's worth 10% of the grade, and perhaps the most challenging part of the assignment.</li></ul></li></li></ul></td>

### Important notes

* Note: Your code **must** compile and run on the Khoury machines. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* Note: You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* And do not forget, if we do not see your most recent changes 'pushed into this repository' (i.e. what you see on github.com), then we cannot grade them. Updates to the repository must be before the assignment deadline!
