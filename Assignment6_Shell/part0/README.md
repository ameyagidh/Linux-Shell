# Part 0

There is no deliverable for this section. However, below are some tips for this assignment.

- You really need to understand how example5 works and example 6 in the previous lab.
- I would suggest that example5 serves as your starting point.
- I would suggest coming up with a gameplan on paper, before jumping into the code.
  - What is the control flow at a high level (i.e. What will the main function be doing. What will the main loop be doing. How will you handle executing one command. How will you handle executing a built-in command versus exec'ing a program.).
- Make small incremental changes. 
  - For example, start off by writing a program that just echo's (i.e. printf's) whatever command a user has typed.
    - Then think about how how to fork/exec commands or execute built-in commands.


In addition to example6 in the lab, it may be useful to read another tutorial on how pipes work: https://tldp.org/LDP/lpg/node11.html
